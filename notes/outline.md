## Outline

*In this project, instead of defining the concepts right from the beginning and demonstrating them, I believe that it is more fit to introduce a few different problems. The problems will be disagreements between different observers on the different properties of an object, each representing a part of the reference frame that needs to be implemented, then at the very end the solutions of these problems will be assembled together into the definition of the reference frame.*

* Situation 1: 
  * Settings: Stationary observers and an oriented object.
  * Problem: How do the observers come to an agreement with each other about the orientation and position of the object.
  * Solution: introduce an universal origin and a direction system [a compass] that allows both observers to *convert* their own reference frames [centred at their origin] into a **shared** reference frame. 
* Situation 2:
  * [To be added]
