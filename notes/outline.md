## Outline

*In this project, instead of defining the concepts right from the beginning and demonstrating them, I believe that it is more fit to introduce a few different problems. The problems will be disagreements between different observers on the different properties of an object, each representing a part of the reference frame that needs to be implemented, then at the very end the solutions of these problems will be assembled together into the definition of the reference frame.*

* Situation 1: 
  * Settings: Stationary observers and an oriented object.
  * Problem: How do the observers come to an agreement with each other about the orientation and position of the object.
  * Solution: introduce an universal origin and a direction system [a compass] that allows both observers to *convert* their own reference frames [centred at their origin] into a **shared** reference frame. 
* Situation 2:
  * Setting: Stationary, moving observer and an object that is moving at the same velocity as the moving observer
  * Problem: The stationary observer and the moving observer disagree on the motion of the object, stationary observer says that it is moving and moving observer says that it is stationary
  * Solution: The moving observer and the stationary observer are using different reference frames. The moving observer's reference frame is moving with the same velocity as the object is on the stationary observer's reference frame.
* Situation 3:
  * remarks: this situation is quite similar to situation 2, so we can consider this situation as an extension of some sorts, and build on top of situation 2.
  * Setting: stationary, moving observer observing an object following a projectile motion
  * Problem: stationary observer sees that the object is not only going up and then down, but also moving sideways, but the moving observer only reports the object moving up and down.
  * solution: break down the moving object's position into two parts, an x component and a y component. The y component is controlled by the acceleration due to gravity and the x component is a constant velocity because an object in motion stays in motion if no forces are present. As we have seen in situation two, if a reference frame moves with the same velocity as an object, that object is stationary relative to the reference frame. In this example, the apparent velocity to the moving observer is therefore 0 and only the change in height by the moving observer is noticed.
