Hello everyone, I'm Ashmita Bhattacharyya. Today we are going to discuss frames of references. Reference frames are extremely important concepts in physics as they allow for physicists to be able to take meaningful measurements. What's the position, what's the velocity, what's the orientation? All these questions are answered through a concept known as a frame of reference.  

A reference frame is composed of an origin and seeks to describing the position orientation and time information of an object relative to the origin.
