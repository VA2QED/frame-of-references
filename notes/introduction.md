Hello everyone, I'm ________________________. Today we are going to discuss frames of references. In this video, we are not going to give you the definition of a reference frame right now. 

> Animation: definition -> examples [x]
>
> examples -> definition[o]

We want you to be able to discover and understand the dependencies with regards to position, orientation, relative motion and trajectories of objects when two observers aren't in the same reference frame. 

> Animation: position and orientation, relative motion and trajectories

You will soon discover the necessity of reference frames to be able to take meaningful measurements in physics and then hopefully, you will be able to understand the definition of a reference frame at the end of the video.
