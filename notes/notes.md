## ~~Introduction~~

*As previously mentioned, I prefer to define reference frame at the **end** of the presentation instead of the beginning, so I'm scrapping the introduction at the moment - as we gradually introduce the concepts we will re-use this part to cover the left-overs and sum up in the end.*

~~Hello everyone, in this video we would like to explain the concept of a reference frame, in the context of physics and motion.~~

```python
class SelfIntroduction(Scene)
```

~~First and foremost, a reference frame is "assigned" an origin. Consequently, various methods and equiigin. In essnse, a frame of reference seeks to systematically answer the question of where something is in time and space. Also please note that for this video, the observer is placed at the origin for ease. An observer can also be a certain distance away from the origin.

As an example, the positon of this moving green point can be described by saying it is a at a position of x from the origin's x axis and a position of y from the origin's y axis, of course assuming that the right direction indicates motion in the positive direction. This is known as a Cartesian coordinate system, which you may have encountered in math class.

For the purposes of this video, we are only going to discuss inertial reference frames. So, what is an inetial frame of reference? An Inertial reference frame is one that either does not move or moves at a constant speed, with zero acceleration, without changing direction.  An isolated object in this refernce frame would not experience any forces, or "pushes and pulls". For example, if your reference frame is a car moving at a constant velocity, then that is an inertial reference frame. However, a car that is speeding up, slowing down or making a turn (i.e : changing direction) is not considered an inertial reference frame.
