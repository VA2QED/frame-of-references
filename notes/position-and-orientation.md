## Perception of position or orientation

### Orientation

>  [Removed the mention to reference frames] Let us introduce the problem before creating the concepts. Instead of introducing the observers first, it is more optimal to introduce the subject of the discussion - the object. Introducing it first allows the audience to look at the object and come up with their own judgment before the observers' perspectives are presented.
>
>  TODO: it is better to replace the object with something else, be it a car or an arrow that has an orientation associated with it instead of a triangle (directions can be confused if you use a simple shape). 

**Let us say that we have an object, facing this way.**

*Animation: create and rotate object.*

> Introducing the observers. I strongly prefer to not use my name. 
>
> TODO: We also prefer to use simpler names instead of our real names as they are easier to process. Naming observers also face the challenge of labelling the observers and having to reinforce the names throughout the presentation as they can be forgotten. Possible candidates can be the classic *Alice and Bob* or colour-coded observers *Blue and Orange* for example.
>
> Instead of directly saying reference frames, we indirectly indicate their position and orientation.

**And we have two observers, [Top Observer] and [Bottom Observer] facing each other on the opposite end of the screen.** 

*Animation: create and show the observers.*

*Animation: shake the observers (or use some construction on the shape of the observer) to demonstrate their directions.*

> Using using Cartesian coordinate systems and sign conventions is a bit too unreasonable - and you are establishing another reference frame (sneakily) by introducing a separate coordinate system, and that's a no-go.

> Instead of describing the situation in an "observer" tone, ask questions to try to have some engagement with the audience.

**So, which way is the object facing?**

> As mentioned earlier - using a shape makes describing the directions more difficult. 
>
> We are also separating orientation and position since asking them together can force too much information to be processed at once.
>
> We then present the perspectives on the directions.

*Animation: darken bottom observer and potentially zoom in as we introduce the perspective of the top observer.*

*Animation: show the "axis" of the top observer. Show all 4 directions and label them "front, back, left, right".*

**[Top Observer] would say that the object is facing their left.**

*Animation: extend (emphasise) and potentially brighten the "left" arrow and stretch the object to show the congruency in their orientation.*

*Animation: hide the "axis" of the top observer.*

*Animation: brighten the bottom observer as we exit the perspective of the top observer.*

> Present the perspectives of bottom observer.

*Animation: darken top observer and potentially zoom in as we introduce the perspective of the bottom observer.*

*Animation: show the "axis" of the bottom observer. Show all 4 directions and label them "front, back, left, right".*

**[Bottom Observer] would say that the object is facing their right.** 

*Animation: extend (emphasise) and potentially brighten the "right" arrow and stretch the object to show the congruency in their orientation.*

*Animation: hide the "axis" of the bottom observer.*

*Animation: brighten the bottom observer as we exit the perspective of the bottom observer.*

> Then present the conflict between the observers - they do not have an agreement on the orientation of the object.

**So which way is the object facing? There can be only one, right?**

*Animation: shake [rotate] or stretch the object to emphasise its direction.*

*Animation: show and shake question marks above the observers.*

> Here, present a hint to the solution: there is no disagreement.

**Now you may have realised the two observers are talking about the same direction, they just call it differently.**

*Animation: show the "axis" of the observers again and stretch the arms to show that they are facing the same direction.*

> Then introduce an universal direction system, the compass always points at the same direction.

**Then how can the two observers [use their names here instead] come to an agreement? They decide to look for something that they can both have, and found a compass. **

*Animation: hide the observers and the object to introduce the compass.*

*Animation: Show a compass. [This may be a bit difficult to make, but a circle and two triangles with a smaller circle in the centre will do the trick.] Then shake it while keeping the arrows facing the same direction.*

> Specify that the compass always points at the same direction to clear up any potential confusion and make sure that people realise that this system can be shared.

**The compass always points to the same direction, no matter of where you put it and how you rotate it. **

*Note: for this instance, the compass will have its red arrow always pointing **right** as that will be the direction of the object.*

*Animation: hide the compass (make it fade away).*

*Animation: show the observers and the object again.*

**The two observers [use their names here instead] decided to each take a compass and take a look at the object again.**

*Animation: give each observer a compass.*

> Ask the same question again, though the question did not change, the observers have now been equipped the same tool to measure the direction, therefore the response would be different.

**So which way, is the object facing?**

*Animation: show the "axis" of both observers, but still label them with "left right" directions.*

**This time, they decide to use their compass.**

> Demonstrate that the use of the compass makes a difference in the observations.

*Animation: change the "right" axis of both observers to be **red**, and replace the labels with "north, south, west, east".*

**The object is facing north.**

*Animation: extend and brighten the north axis of **both** observers and then stretch the object to show the congruency in their orientation.*

> Explicitly state the conclusion of the experience for people who have not realised.

**By choosing to use the compass as their common reference in their directions, the two observers come to an agreement with the direction of the object.**

> In case *you* haven't realised, based on the raw information here, you should know why I am separating direction and position now.

*Animation: hide the axis of both observers.*

### Position

> After the first problem is resolved, introduce the second one. 

**Now that they [use the observers' names here] have come to an agreement with the direction, they begun thinking about a new question.**

**Where is the object?**

> Present the perspective of the top observer.

*Animation: darken bottom observer and potentially zoom in as we introduce the perspective of the top observer.*

*Animation: show the top observer's axis now labelled with compass directions.*

*Animation: show a Cartesian plane centred at the top observer*

**[Top Observer] would say that the object is [some units] to their north and [some units] to their east.**

*Animation: draw dotted lines from the object to the axis of the Cartesian plane, then highlight the axis on the Cartesian plane and label them to show the distance.*

*Animation: hide the axis and the cartesian plane of the top observer.*

*Animation: brighten the bottom observer and zoom out as we exit the perspective of the top observer.*

> Present the perspective of the bottom observer.

*Animation: darken top observer and potentially zoom in as we introduce the perspective of the bottom observer.*

*Animation: show the bottom observer's axis and Cartesian plane.*

**[Bottom Observer] would say that the object is [some units] to their north and [some units] to their west.**

*Animation: draw dotted lines from the object to the axis of the Cartesian plane, then highlight the axis on the Cartesian plane and label them to show the distance.*

*Animation: hide the axis and the cartesian plane of the bottom observer.*

*Animation: brighten the top observer and zoom out as we exit the perspective of the bottom observer.*

> Present the conflict between the observers again.

**So, where is the object? It's only at one position right?**

*Animation: shake the object to emphasise its position.*

**Same as before, the observers are talking about the same position, but are describing it differently.**

> Then present a solution: universal coordinate system.
>
> The reference object can be anything - however it must be different from the original object and have no orientation, this is to make sure that it stands out and that it does not suggest any directions - since the observers are using compasses to represent directions.

**The two observers [use their names here instead] decided to look for something that they can both reference upon. Luckily, the found [reference object].**

*Animation: show the reference object.*

**The [reference object] stays in one place no matter where the two observers go.**

*Animation: shake reference object.*

> Present the question again

**So, where is the object?**

*Animation: show the axis of both observers, but shake them as they are incompatible.*

*Animation: show and shake question marks above the observers.*

> Demonstrate that the use of an universal reference makes a difference in the observations.

*Animation: hide the axis of both observers.*

*Animation: show a Cartesian plane and axis centred at the reference object.*

**They decide to look at the object again, but with respect to [reference object] instead.**

*Animation: draw a line from the reference object to the object.*

**The object is [some units] to the north of the [reference object].**

*Animation: highlight the line to show that the observers are in agreement.*

**By choosing a common point of reference, the two observers come to an agreement to the position of the object.**
