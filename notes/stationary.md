# Stationary Definition
###### The purpose of this section is to discuss what we mean when two things are stationary. This concept has been brought up multiple times while discussing motion

## Title screen

show Concept of being Stationary

## Stationary example

Before we discuss any examples of motion, we are going to discuss the concept of being stationary.

> Set up problem: Number plane, two observers in two rectangles 

Let's say that two observers are driving on a road. Both of them are going to travel at the same speed in the same direction

> both observers move in unison with the same velocity

Both observers will look at each other and agree that they are stationary with respect to each other. 

Imagine that we put a measuring tape between the two cars. You will notice that throughout the entire process, the distance between the two cars are the same and the angle of the ruler will also stay the same.

> Take a thick line run between two cars and move it around again.

Also, note that both cars actually have the same velocity.

> Text: Two observers with the same velocity are stationary with each other.
