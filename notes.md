## Introduction

Hello everyone, in this video we are going to attempt to explain the concept of a reference frame.

```python
class SelfIntroduction(Scene)
```



First of all, a reference frame is composed of an origin and methods of describing the position and orientation of an object relative to the origin. A frame of reference seeks to systematically answer the question of where something is in space. Also please note that we are assuming that the observer is at the origin for ease. An observer can also be a certain distance away from the origin.

```python
class ReferenceFrameDefWords(Scene)
```



As an example, this moving green point can be described by saying it is a at a position of x from the origin's x axis and a position of y from the origin's y axis, of course assuming that the right direction indicates a positive . This is known as a Cartesian coordinate system.

```python
class ReferenceFrameExample(Scene)
```



For the purposes of this video, we are only going to explain what is known as inertial reference frames. Inertial reference frames are frames of references in which itself is not experiencing a force, or "pushes and pulls". For example, if your reference frame is a car moving at a constant velocity, then that is an inertial reference frame. However, a car that is speeding up or slowing down is not an inertial reference frame.

```python
class InertialReferenceFrameDisclaimer(Scene)
```
